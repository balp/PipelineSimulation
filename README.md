Pipeline Simulation
===================

This repo lets you play with different pipeline designs and lets you come up with scenarios 
for how the pipeline could be used. Work in progress.

Usage
-----

Run the self tests with (py.test)[http://pytest.org]

Run the various simulations to create sample pipeline data

    python3 src/simulation1.py

Todo
----
- manual testers test at specific times similar to how deploys are done
- bugs in production and recovery
- timer pipeline triggers
- commit frequency increasing towards deadline then dropping
- realistic pipeline simulation examples
- metrics cheat
